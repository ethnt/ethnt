### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer using Elixir, Ruby, and JavaScript to make web products. Iâ€™ve been doing computer-y stuff for ten years, and Iâ€™m currently a software engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com). Previously, I was a software engineer at [Enlitic](https://enlitic.com), a software engineer at [Aircall](https://aircall.io), a full-stack developer at [Oak](https://oak.is) and a web developer at [Fanzter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzter).
