### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer using Elixir, Ruby, and JavaScript to make web products. Iâ€™ve been doing computer-y stuff for ten years, and Iâ€™m currently a software engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) working on the [Web Presence & Platform team](https://stripe.com/jobs/search?q=web+presence). Previously I've worked at companies in [artificial intelligence](https://enlitic.com), [telecommunications](https://aircall.io), and [design](https://oak.is), as well as doing freelance work in healthcare, real estate, and travel.
