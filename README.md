### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Brooklyn, NY-based software developer using Elixir, Ruby, and JavaScript to make web products. Iâ€™ve been working on the web for over a decade, most recently as a software engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) working on the Web Presence & Platform team. Previously I've worked at companies in [artificial intelligence](https://enlitic.com), [telecommunications](https://aircall.io), and [design](https://oak.is), as well as doing freelance work in healthcare, real estate, and travel.
